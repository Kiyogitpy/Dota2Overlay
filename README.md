Works by using Dota2 GSI, will pulse image based on your game time. 
Need to enable -gamestateintegration in dota2 properties to function.

The overlay will sit in your System Tray ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addf9cf9-df75-4197-afa3-4912e4850672)
and can be right clicked to terminate the application
